You can add words to the vocabulary list or help improve my spaghetti code. 

If you have no experience with coding, to add words to the vocabulary list:
1. Navigate to the file.
2. Press the edit button. (It should look like a pen.)
3. Add your own words. Please note that there should be no space at the back. Please check to prevent repetition.
4. Create Pull Request.
